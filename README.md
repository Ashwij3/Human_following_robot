Human Tracking Robot Perception Stack
This repository contains the code for a perception stack designed and developed for a human tracking robot. The perception stack utilizes deep learning-based systems for person detection and re-identification.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
Installation
To install the dependencies, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the perception stack, run the following command:

Copy code
python perception_stack.py
Algorithms used
The perception stack utilizes the following algorithms:

YOLOv5 for human detection and instance segmentation
SuperPoint for feature extraction and matching
Results
The implemented perception stack achieves accurate identification of the target individual, allowing for effective human tracking by the robot.

Perception Stack for Human Tracking Robot
This project implements a perception stack for a human tracking robot, utilizing deep learning-based systems for person detection and re-identification. The system is built using Python and the following libraries:

PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy
Pillow
The perception stack is comprised of two main components: human detection and instance segmentation, and person re-identification. For human detection and instance segmentation, we implemented YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to accurately detect humans in real-time. For feature extraction and matching, we used SuperPoint, a deep learning-based method for local feature extraction and matching, resulting in accurate identification of the target individual.

Installation
To install the required libraries, run the following command:

Copy code
pip install torch opencv-python numpy pillow
Usage
To run the perception stack, simply run the main.py file:

css
Copy code
python main.py
The system will start detecting humans and re-identifying the target individual in real-time.
